\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


\authorcomment1{Todo: Intro topics-- atmospheric escape, variety of exoplanets, extremes, photoevaporation, Fulton Gap, Helium 10830 backgorund, etc...}

%Exoplanet atmospheres must exhibit an unimaginable dynamic range in physical and chemical properties, spanning familiar life-sustaining worlds to uninhabitable toxic wastelands.  Most systems exhibit signals too weak to register with current instruments, so our understanding of the variety of exoplanet atmospheres has been built on a foundation of comparative studies \citep{2016Natur.529...59S}, population studies \citep{2017AJ....154..109F}, and theoretical understanding.  Extreme atmospheres offer the benefit of being more conspicuous, while challenging the limits of the imagination and motivating new directions for building theory.  


At least 8 systems have Helium 10830 exosphere measurements to date: \object[GJ 3470]{GJ3470} \citep{2020ApJ...894...97N, 2021A&A...647A.129L}, \object{HD 63433 c} \citep{2022AJ....163...68Z}, WASP 107 b \citep{2019A&A...623A..58A,2020AJ....159..115K}, HD 209458 b \citep{2019A&A...629A.110A}, WASP 69 b \citep{2020AJ....159..278V}, WASP 52 b \citep{2020AJ....159..278V}, HD 189733 b \citep{2021A&A...647A.129L}, and HAT-P-18 b \citep{2021ApJ...909L..10P}.


Here we present a study of the exosphere of HAT-P-67b.  HAT-P-67 is an F type sub-giant with the Saturn-sized planet HAT-P-67b.  HAT-P-67b has a low surface gravity, which makes it amenable to rapid atmospheric mass loss.  It orbits an evolved star, which means its instellation may have increased as the star's size has grown.  The star appears close to the star, making it conceivable that star-planet interactions could be at play.  These and other reasons make HAT-P-67b a unique laboratory for measuring the properties of exospheres and their interactions with their host stars.  The system appears to consist of a binary with an M dwarf companion HAT-P-67B separated by $9\farcs0$.

\section{Observations}
\subsection{Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF)}

The Habitable Zone Planet Finder Spectrograph \citep[HPF][]{2012SPIE.8446E..1SM,2014SPIE.9147E..1GM, 2019Optic...6..233M} on the queue-scheduled 10-meter \emph{Hobby-Eberly Telescope} \citep[HET][]{1998SPIE.3352...34R} operates in the near-IR from $8100-12800~\AA\;$ spanning the \textit{z}, \textit{Y}, and \textit{J} bands at spectral resolving power $R=55,000$. The HET fixed-elevation design \citep{2007PASP..119..556S} limits the observability of HAT-P-67 to less than 1 hour ``tracks'' for a fixed range of hour angles before (east track) and after (west track) transiting the meridian.  Whereas conventional steerable telescopes could conduct cintinuous point-and-stare observations of HAT-P-67 for hours, HET cannot.  In practice, this limitation means that in-transit and out-of-transit were rarely possible on the same night.  Instead, we organized the observations into four campaigns to coincide with HAT-P-67b transits on the nights beginning 2020 April 28, 2020 May 22, 2020 June 15, and 2022 April 28.  These in-transit nights had up to 14 exposures per HET track, with integration times between 5-8.5 minutes.  We obtained out-of-transit baseline observations up to 2 nights before and after the transit, plus random-in-phase low priority P4 queue-filler observations.  These out-of-transit observations typically received 4 or fewer individual exposures.  We observed HAT-P-67 with HPF for a total 41 visits on 39 unique nights, with two of those nights observing both an east and a west track.  The total on-source integration time exceeds 13.8 hours.  Table \ref{tabHPFLog} summarizes the log of observations.

The observation scheduling was strategically restricted to the spring season when the Barycentric Earth Radial Velocity (BERV) would Doppler shift telluric absorption lines sufficiently far away from the core of the Helium 10833$\AA~$ feature.  The small BERV still means the redward Helium linewing has significant telluric contamination between 10834-10836$\AA$, but the core and blue line wings appear relatively pristine.

Only 19 out of the 39 nights possess A0V telluric calibration standard stars.  These standard stars, when available, were used to spot-check our telluric mitigation strategy.

\subsection{TESS Light Curve}
HAT-P-67 was observed with the \emph{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} \citep[TESS][]{2014SPIE.9143E..20R} in Sectors 24, 26, 51, 52, 53 with 2-minute cadence, and in Sector 25 with 30-minute (FFI) cadence.  The Sector 25 FFI data appeared malformed, possibly due to problems with pipeline CCD smear correction, and was disregarded.

\subsection{ASAS-SN}
We retrieved ground-based photometry with the \emph{All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae} (ASAS-SN) using the Sky-Portal \citep{shappee14,2017PASP..129j4502K}.  The precision of ASAS-SN was too low to perceive stellar variability, and so the photometry is not presented further.

\subsection{DASCH}
HAT-P-67 appears in the Harvard Plate Archive, with 5809 measurements digitized through DASCH, spanning over 120 years of coarse photometric monitoring.  In principle these datasets could inform long-term variability trends such as stellar cycles.  In practice the 0.15 magnitude jitter appears too coarse to perceive any genuine astrophysical variability, with no conspicuous trend seen.  We can therefore place a relatively mild constraint that the star is stable at the $30\%$ level over periods of tens to hundreds of years.

\subsection{Gaia DR3}
HAT-P-67A (\emph{Gaia DR3 1358614983131339392}) has a parallax of $2.69\pm0.01$ mas in \emph{Gaia} DR3, placing it at about 372$\pm$1.4 pc, slightly farther than previously estimated by \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z} using Gaia DR1. Its coarse Gaia-based estimates for RV and Doppler broadening are consistent with the more precise values published in \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z}.  Its wide companion HAT-P-67B (\emph{Gaia DR3 1358614983131339904}) \citep{2019MNRAS.490.5088M} has statistically identical parallax ($2.58\pm0.05$) and proper motions, confirming its interpretation as co-moving, with projected separation of about 3400 AU.

\subsection{Other archives}
We searched for observations of HAT-P-67 in public archives.  It has one $R\sim8000$ spectrum from the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph on the INT, centered near 4000 $\AA$.  It has 26 photometry points from \emph{Pan-STARRS} spread across its 5 filters.  The other archival observations have been previously reported by \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z}, including Keck HIRES, Keck NIRC2, and WIYN High-Resolution Infrared Camera.  The northern source does not appear in ESO archives, nor the Gemini Archive, and it is not publicly accessible in the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF) archive.  It was not targeted by Spitzer or Hubble.

\subsection{TESS Light Curve}

\subsubsection{Revised exoplanet orbital parameters}
We assembled a composite lightcurve by stitching TESS Sectors 24, 26, 51, 52, 53, which were reduced with the default SPOC pipeline \citep{2020RNAAS...4..201C}, and lightly post-processed with \texttt{lightkurve} \citep{geert_barentsen_2019_2565212}.  These TESS data exhibit an RMS scatter of better than 1 part-per-thousand (ppt) at native 2-minute sampling.  We fit a Keplerian orbit model to the TESS lightcurve using the \texttt{exoplanet} framework \citep{exoplanet:joss}.  We obtained a best fit orbital period of $4.81011$ days, non-zero eccentricity of 0.19, an impact parameter of 0.46, planet-to-star radius of 0.0823, transit depth of 0.74\%, and $T_0$ of 1958.07933 in BTJD.  These properties are consistent with the previously reported values from \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z}.  Figure \ref{fig:transit} shows the best-fit orbit overlaid on the detrended TESS lightcurve.  Table \ref{tabOrbit} lists one of the previous orbit determinations and solution reported here.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/best_fit_orbit.png}
    \caption{Best fit orbit overlaid on the composite TESS lightcurve.  The 1 ppt TESS precision improves upon the ground-based detection and refining the orbital properties and ephemerides.}
    \label{fig:transit}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Stellar rotation rate from periodogram analysis}

The TESS Sector 26 lightcurve exhibits a weak $\sim3\;$ppt peak-to-valley out-of-transit modulation on timescales comparable to the exoplanet orbit. TESS Sectors 51-53 do not show as conspicuous a modulation signal.  Figure \ref{fig:TESSmodulation} shows this modulation in the minimally processed TESS lightcurve.  During the exoplanet orbit fitting, we fit the TESS lightcurve modulation with a quasiperiodic Gaussian Process (GP) model using \texttt{celerite} \citep{celerite1,celerite2}.  The GP model fit to the entire composite lightcurve yields a period of 4.7 days; when fit to individual sectors alone the periods hover around 5.9 days.

If we attribute the TESS modulation signal to stellar activity, we obtain a rotation period $P_\mathrm{rot}$ between 4.7 and 5.9 days.  \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z} estimated $v\sin{i}=35.8\pm1.1$ km/s, or lower ($v\sin{i}=30\pm1.1$ km/s) if macroturbulence was accounted for.  We obtain a combined geometric constraint $2.85< R_\star \sin{i} (R_\odot) < 4.2 $.  The lower end of these constraints are consistent with  the 1-$\sigma$ range of $2.0 < R_\star (R_\odot) < 3.2$ provided in \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z} from different isochrones and orbit fits, and assuming a near-edge-on orbital inclination.  The Gaia \emph{DR3}-derived distance is 8\% greater than the \emph{Gaia} DR1 estimate used in \citet{2017AJ....153..211Z}; the revised larger distance would tend to increase the radius estimate by 16\% to match the observed SED in isochrone-fitting.  We would therefore expect an isochrone-deived $R_\star$ range closer to $2.5-3.14 R_\odot$, where we have dropped the 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties which had included the less certain Gaia DR 1 parallax and its uncertain correction terms.  For a fixed $R_p/R_\star$, the larger $R_\star$ implies a proportionally larger planet radius, revising the already-low density of HAT-P-67 even lower.

\subsection{HPF analysis}
Ideally we seek the pixel-to-pixel substructured spectrum of the helium exosphere, corrected for all the conceivable instrumental, telluric, and stellar contamination artifacts.  In practice, these corrections are incomplete.  We experimented with a range of pre-processing and analysis techniques to quantify the accuracy and precision of our HPF spectra.

The raw 2D echellograms were reduced with the \texttt{Goldilocks} package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/grzeimann/Goldilocks_Documentation}}, which outputs 1D extracted spectra for the target, and two reference fibers: blank sky and a laser frequency comb (LFC).  The observations were acquired with the LFC turned off, so this unilluminated spectrum was discarded.

The sky fiber and target fiber have slightly different throughputs and illumination properties so the sky fiber must be scaled prior to subtraction from the target spectrum.  On average the target fiber sees $93\%$ of the flux of the sky reference fiber, and at the few percent level this ratio depends on wavelength and season.  We quantified the wavelength dependence by acquiring calibration observations of blank sky in both the target and sky fiber.  We applied this wavelength-based scale factor to each target spectrum's associated reference sky fiber to achieve near-imperceptible sky-line residuals.  A few lines exhibit residuals which may arise from genuine differences in the local atmospheric conditions between the target and sky fiber.

We masked spectral regions predicted to have significant telluric lines with a template generated by \texttt{telfit} \citep{2014AJ....148...53G}.  We shifted the spectral coordinates to their common barycentric-corrected reference frame \citep{2014PASP..126..838W} as implemented in \texttt{astropy} \citep{2013A&A...558A..33A,2018AJ....156..123A}.  We flattened the spectra to two pre-selected continuum indices highlighted as vertical blue bands in Figure \ref{fig:HPFheliumOverview}.  The sky-subtraction, telluric masking, barycentric correction, flattening, and all of our other standard pre-processing steps were carried out in the open-source Python interface \texttt{muler} \citep{2022JOSS....7.4302G}.

Figure \ref{fig:HPFheliumOverview} shows a zoom-in on the He 10830 region of interest, with all 153 individual exposures overlaid.  We see a variability in the Helium line of up to 10\%, much greater than the $<1\%$ pixel-to-pixel variation.  The feature width spans about 3 $\AA~$, comparable to the stellar rotationally lines too broad to originate from the much narrower telluric lines.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/HAT_P_67b_He_spectrum.png}
    \caption{Overlay of all 128 individual HPF exposures of HAT-P-67, spanning 2020-2022. Variability is seen in the Helium 10833 $\AA$ band, denoted by the vertical orange shaded band, but not in the adjacent regions.  These snapshot spectra were barycentric corrected, and continuum flattened to the regions in the blue vertical bands.  Sharp telluric absorption lines have been masked in regions near 10835 and 10837.5 $\AA$.}
    \label{fig:HPFheliumOverview}
\end{figure}


The 13.8 hours of exposure, combined with HAT-P-67b's short ($P\sim4.8$ day) period, means that a large fraction of the orbit has been collected, with some phases (especially near transit) heavily sampled, and some other out-of-transit phases sampled only sparsely. We constructed a 2-D intensity phase scan, binning in phase and wavelength, and spanning the entire orbit of HAT-P-67.  Figure \ref{fig:HPFphase2D} overlays the planet's approximately $\pm150\;$km/s orbital Doppler velocity, with the stellar rest frame velocity demarcated by the vertical line.  The vanishing $<36$ m/s reflex motion of the star is imperceptible at this scale.  The horizontal dashed lines indicate the transit ingress, midcenter, and egress.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/phase_2D_diagram.png}
    \caption{Phase scan of intensity for HAT-P-67.  The spectrum flux intensity shows significant in-transit absorption during and before the transit.  Telluric lines redward of the line center have been masked.  An unmasked telluric line near 10825 $\AA$ can be seen.}
    \label{fig:HPFphase2D}
\end{figure}

A large absorption signal can be seen preceding transit ingress, with some significant absorption evident before $-0.2$ in phase.  We construct a fractional residual absorption spectrum by subtracting off and re-normalizing to the non-varying baseline.  We define the non-varying baseline spectrum as the average over phases $0.3-0.5$, which exhibited stable spectra with the lease absorption.  Figure \ref{fig:HPFscanResid} shows a conspicuous view of the Helium absorption of HAT-P-67b.  Significant absorption can be seen as a few percent at $-0.37$ in phase, rising to 10\% just before and during transit.  The egress drop off is extremely sharp, with almost no absorption directly after transit.

The absorption resides mostly near the stellar zero restframe velocity reference.  As mentioned previously, the telluric masking near 10836 $\AA$ censors our view of the existence (or not) of any redshifted lobe in this region.  A more careful treatment of the telluric absorption could rescue some of the data in this region.

Finally, a tentative much weaker post-egress bifurcation into blue-shifted absorption and redshifted emission may exist near 0.1 in phase.  The signal appears at or just above the noise level, but is shared among tens of pixels.

\subsection{Calcium IR Triplet and other line diagnostics}
We examined the Calcium IR Triplet lines (Ca IRT) for evidence of variability.  No variation was seen in these features, which were pre-processed in the same way as the Helium feature.  Figure \ref{fig:CaPhaseScan} shows a similar phase plot as Figure \ref{fig:HPFscanResid}, adapted to the line at 8662 $\AA$.  We see no conspicuous variability at this or any of the other Ca IRT lines.  We also found no detectable variability in the Pa$\delta$ line at 10050 $\AA$, nor other deep lines at 10330 $\AA$ and elsewhere.  Helium 10830 appears to be the only conspicuously variable line in the HPF spectrum.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Geometry of the Escaping Exosphere}
Helium absorption occurs before the planet is in-transit, indicating a \emph{leading} tail escaping the planet. We see excess as early as 30\% of the orbital path, or about 130 planetary radii.

\subsection{Parker Winds Model}


\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Hot Spot Scenario}
The TESS 0.2\% flux variation could hypothetically arise from the foot-print of a star-planet interaction. Assuming that this increase in flux is due to a hot spot with a contrast of 200\% the ambient photosphere in the TESS bandpass, the hot spot would have a modest 5\% coverage fraction.  Thermal radiation from gravitational infall alone cannot explain the luminosity of this spot, so it would have to stem from a non-thermal cause.

\subsection{Tidal Locking Calculation}
The similarity of the rotation period with the orbital period suggests the star-planet system may be tidally locked.

\subsection{Mass Loss Rate}
A steady state mass loss rate greater than $2\times10^{12}$ g/s would erode the planet over the age of the stellar system.
